Project Description
-----------------------------

In this project we have performed analysis on the US and Australian economies. We have tried to find relationship between inflation and wage growth as well as between inflation and oil prices and we have answered questions such as: does the Australian economy follow the patterns of the US economy?

Data Sources
--------------

We have extracted data from a number of data sources, including doing a NASDAQ API to fetch the global oil prices for the last 20 years.

Coding
---------

As first steps, we cleaned and merged several data sets. To perform analysis, we have used the Pandas library to make dataframes and Matplotlib library to plot charts.

Analysis
----------
We have answered four questions for this analysis.

1) Q: What is the relationship between the US and Australian inflation? A: They follow a similar pattern.

2) Q: What is the relationship between the US and Australian wage growth to inflation? A: Both US and Australian wage growths follow the trends of inflation but have lagged behind historically.

3) Q: Do global oil prices affect inflation in the US and Australia? A: As it is clear in the oil prices vs inflation charts above, the global oil prices do influence the inflation rate in both the US and Australia. If oil prices go up, the inflation rate follow suit and go up. The converse is also true.

4) Q: Does Australian economy follow the pattern of the US economy? A: The patterns of wage growth and inflation in both countries are very similar. Also, oil prices affect inflation in both countries in similar patterns. So we can say that YES, the Australian economy does follow the patterns of the US economy.
